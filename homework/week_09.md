# Week 09 Questions


1. **What is your goal with respect to your research project to get accomplished this week?**
My goal for this week is to run my DESeq2 analysis and hopefully WGCNA. Then next week I can focus on figures.

2. **What is the overall status of your research repo? Is it will organized with a clear Readme file? Are file names and directory clear? Would your classmates be able to understand what the code in your files is designed to do?**
My research repo is in decent shape. I definitely need to comment my code more though and add context for the project to my README. But I am pretty happy with my workflow diagram and will be improving it with the steps I've been adding to my project.

3. **Go to one of your classmates rpubs link (see issues). What are three things you think are neat? What are two things that are really not that clear to you?**
I really like Courtney's nested table of contents, the font od the theme she chose, and embedded links to code files and outputs. It's a little unclear what some of her code chunks are, specifically section 2.8 looks like only chunk run outputs, so it would be nice to see the code that generated them. It's also unclear what the DEG figure tells us, so it would be nice to have some text describing general trends or metrics.
