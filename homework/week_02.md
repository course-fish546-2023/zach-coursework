## Week 02 Question Set

a)  **What do you feel was the most impressive thing you did in class last week was?**
I'm always in awe of how quick doing a blast is. I can totally see how tools like this revolutionized genomics.

b)  **What is your weekly goal for making progress on your project? What is the next step?**
I still need to get my repo README together, so one of my goals is to add research context, dataset source links, and progress tracking. Next step is to get back to coding and comment out the code I already have.

c)  **There were two readings this week not from the textbook, meant for two different audiences. Which reading did you get the most out of and why? Do you have any questions regarding the Journal of Shellfish Research paper?**
I think I got the most out of the Mutlifactorial MarineOmics reading purely because it provided a step by step walk through with accompanying code. I find that the most valuable resources for me actually completing analyses are those that show code, providing an example I can really wrap my head around. That said I think I also got a lot out of the functional genomics paper in terms of further conceptualizing bioinformatics workflows.

d)  **What is your favorite thing about markdown and why?**
I like how simple markdown is while still maintaining a lot of functionality. I think other platforms for displaying information have a steep learning curve, but with markdown you can get started right away as long as you know a few things about formatting. 

e) **What is the differnce between `curl` and `wget`? When would you used one over the other?**
Curl and wget complete similar functions. Wget can only download files via HTTP or FTP and also has a recursive option. Curl can transfer files using more protocols than wget (i.e. SFTP, SCP). It's best to use wget under the following circumstances:
* You want to download files recursively, for example, to download an entire website.
* You need to resume interrupted downloads.
* You want to download multiple files in one command.
* You want to download from FTP servers.
And it's best to use curl under the following circumstances:
* You want to transfer data using various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DICT, TELNET, etc.
* You want to test API endpoints.
* You want to perform HTTP requests such as POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, etc.
* You want to download or upload files using various protocols.
