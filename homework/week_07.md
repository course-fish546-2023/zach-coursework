# Week 07 Questions

a)  **What is your current grade in the class? How many issues are open in your research repository?**
My current cumulative grade is not good. I'm sitting at a 50%, but I'm still catching up from missing the first couple of weeks. I'll have everything in order of the next couple of weeks and comment on assignments as I do this. I have no open issues in my research repo.

b)  **Re-reading this week's reading, what are 2 things that resonate with you now that made little practical sense in week 2. What is one aspect that you still wonder about or is unclear?**
I think sequence read mapping makes a lot more sense to me now. At first, I think it can be hard to recognize the difference between a file that contains sequencing data as opposed to a file that acts as an index or map to for the aforementioned sequencing data file(s). I also had it in my head that many of the tools listed in the paper did different things, whereas now I understand that many of them do the same things and have nested functions that can complete an array of tasks. However, one thing I still wonder about is how you decide which tool is best for the task at hand, since so many do the same thing. Is it a matter of personal preference? Precedent within literature? Or should we be comparing the outputs of different tools to make the best choice?

c)  **What is epigenetics and how could it relate to your own research project?**
Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. It involves alterations in DNA packaging structure, modifications in specific chemical groups, and the influence of environmental factors, such as diet, stress, or toxins.

d)  **Describe what a GFF file is?**
A GFF is a file format commonly used in bioinformatics to represent genomic annotations, such as genes, transcripts, exons, and other genomic features. GFF files are plain text files that use a tab-separated format to represent each feature on a single line. Each line in a GFF file represents a genomic feature and contains a series of attributes that describe the feature, such as its start and end positions, strand, name, and type.

e)  **What are two ways describing CG motifs could have value?**
Describing CG motifs can have value in assessing DNA methylation. CpG motifs are the primary targets for DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification where a methyl group is added to the cytosine nucleotide. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation, cellular differentiation, and genomic imprinting. It can also have value in learning about gene regulation. CpG islands, which are regions with a high density of CpG motifs, are often found near gene promoters. These regions play a crucial role in gene regulation by providing binding sites for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins.
