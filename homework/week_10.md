# Week 10 Questions


1.  **Looking back on the quarter what are two things you were not expecting to learn but did, glad you did, and how would you implement this knowledge beyond this class?**
I wasn't really expecting to engage at all with Quarto, but I do like how visually pleasing it is. I'll probably start trying to ue Quarto exclusively for Rpubs moving forward to communicate my research. I also wasn't expecting to learn so many data processing tools (FastQC, HISAT2, StringTie, etc.). This means I am much more comfortable working with raw data. I think this will really come in handy for my ability to create pipelines from scratch.  

2.  **Rank the following from 1-5, with 1 being your best friend and 5 being your enemy (raven, rstudio, knitr, bash, github)**
RStudio, bash, Raven, GitHub, knitr

3.  **As part of your research project you must of learned something beyond methods. What is the most important biological finding from your work to to date? Assuming you follow this line of research what is your long term goal of what you expect to learn about biology, ecology, or the environment?**
I think the most important biological finding from my work is that lncRNAs do not appear very responsive to the nutrient enrichment treatment. Only 22 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed when compared to the control. My long-term goal for this work will be to better understand and identify these lncRNAs. It will be interesting to see if they are implacated in any functions related to nutrient metabolism.
