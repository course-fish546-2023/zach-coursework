# Week 01 Questions

a. What is your prior experience in this discipline?
I have experience working in the lab generating data for subsequent bioinformatic analysis. I have also been doing this type of work as a part of the Roberts lab, though I need a lot of improvement on execution.

b. What do you hope to get out of this class?
I'm hopeing to get more comfortable creating my own bioinformatics pipelines. I would also like to get better at working with large datasets.

c. This class is strongly rooted in an independent project related to genomic analyses. What specific project do you have in mind? If you do not have any data or preference, data can be provided / aquired. If you do not have a specfic project, what approach would you like to master as part of this class?
I am planning on identifying long non-coding RNAs in *Pocillopora verrucosa* using RNA-seq data from a nutrient exposure experiment completed by Danielle Becker at URI.

d. What are two things you found most useful from the reading?
I found the framing around bioinformatics as a discipline most interesting. The two things I found most useful were to treat your data as "read only" (ensuring that you are not corrupting raw data) and to never trust your tools and data (skepticism that can protect you from errors).
